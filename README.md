**DISCO ARMOR**

_Disco Armor_ adds some cool color changing leather armor to the spigot server it is
running on. But it is no awful randomized flickering color changing, quite the reverse!
_Disco Armor_ utilizes a changing `hue` value for colorization. If you want the color of
the armor to change faster or slower, simply edit the `speed` value in main class of the
plugin (`net/tmxx/discoarmor/DiscoArmor.java`) to a higher or lower value.
